This project includes parsers that are used for Vulnmap Infrastructure As Code product. Parsers convert the files they take as input into JSON. 

## Supported formats

The following file formats are supported:
- HCL2: [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)'s default configuration format, parser's source can be found [here](http://https://github.com/khulnasoft-lab/vulnmap-iac-parsers/blob/main/pkg/hcl2.go).
- Terraform Plan(JSON): [Terraform plan output in json](https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/json-format.html) is parsed and ``resource_changes`` element is extracted. Parser's source can be found [here](https://github.com/khulnasoft-lab/vulnmap-iac-parsers/blob/main/pkg/terraform_plan.go).
- YAML: Parser's source can be found [here](https://github.com/khulnasoft-lab/vulnmap-iac-parsers/blob/main/pkg/yaml.go).

All the formats above are transformed into JSON so that they can be used as input into tools such as [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/). 

## Development

Tests can be run using the `go test` command:

```bash
% go test ./...
```
